Cryptsky!
---------------
Your files have been encrypted. This is normally the part where I would
tell you to pay a ransom, and I will send you the decryption key. However, this
is an open source project to show how easy malware can be to write and to allow
others to view what may be one of the first fully open source python ransomwares.

This project does not aim to be malicious. The decryption key can be found
below, free of charge. Please be sure to type it in EXACTLY, or you risk losing
your files forever. Do not include the surrounding quotes, but do make sure
to match case, special characters, and anything else EXACTLY!
Happy decrypting and be more careful next time!

Your decryption key is: '{}'
